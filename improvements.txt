ModelCollection/NamespaceCollection/InstanceCollection:
  - Change the events to: 'adding', 'added', etc instead of the gloabl Event object.
    Only use the global events object for subscribing to changes on the Project.
    It makes it easier to sub to changes, and people will remember it better. ie
      project.root.models.on('added', items => ...)
